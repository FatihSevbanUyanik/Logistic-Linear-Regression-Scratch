# Logistic-Linear-Regression-Scratch

Implemented Logistic Regression and Linear Regression from scratch by using only numpy library. Tried out different 
parameters for tuning and reported the results from every aspect. Implemented both batch gradient descent and stochastic 
gradient descent models and applied them to models.
